# WELCOME TO MY RESPOSITORY
DYNAMO API PYTHON

Hi,

"faithful people with the same passion as me"!

I hope work and study always get better day by day. That's one of the reasons to build this repository. I may temporarily call it "Dynamo API - Python". This repository contains all the information and help you need to do well. If you are the first in here, have already visited this repository, or even know about me via my Youtube channel those are an honor and lucky for me. Because I have a chance to share scripts, nodes, functions, and much more as soon as experiences I have. Moreover, my VietNam country has lots of students who want to learn that one. So I want to contribute a few things I know about Dynamo and Revit to help friends have inspirations on the road to career decisions.

This is an exciting time to be learning about, working with, and developing for Dynamo. Let's get started!

Can not wait for add minutes and seconds.!!!

## 2. Cad template

Almost projects Revit has related to Audocad's drawing. As I have worked many Japan projects. I saw that all of their document is Autocad file. You have to import its into Revit. So, extracting data of drawings are an advantage.
